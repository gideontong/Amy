🐱‍🏍 Amy is your personal assisstant, reimagined. In other words, Amy is a Discord bot for the [Dudes of 708 Discord server](https://discord.gg/WUGMTcZ). You can also visit our [YouTube homepage](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdbqUWT3_0WgybqNuCX9uJA) to see the kind of content that is relevant to the usage of Amy. To see the full docs, click [here](docs/README.md). [Click here to add Amy to your Discord server.](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=721503241531162707&permissions=8&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Famyhelps.ml&scope=bot)

Amy builds upon over a decade of experience in social interactions at scale using various messaging platforms, with the current platform of choice being [Discord](https://discord.com) as the community comes together to build best-in-class ideas and practices for our own purposes.

Amy currently runs on [Gideon Tong's Server Network](https://me.gideontong.com) and has been given her own private subdomain space. If you would like to get involved in helping to shape the evolution of not just Amy but also future smart personal assisstants, consider reading the [contributor's guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.

### Achievements

Amy supports custom achievements, which you can add your own instance of the bot (if you're running a custom instance for a private server), and soon will support admin-configurable achievements as well as default achievements that can be enabled globally (across servers) as well as only within a server.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone this repository to your hard drive. You'll need [Node 12.x](https://nodejs.org) or another JS code interpreter. Assuming you have Node installed, simply type

```bash
npm install --production
```

and while Node grabs the dependencies for you, move the file in `config/secrets-blank.json` to `config/secrets.json` and replace `token` with your [Discord API key](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Then start the application with

```bash
npm start
```

### Developers

If you're a developer and would like to get started, see the [setup guide](docs/setup/README.md) in the documentation `/docs` folder.
